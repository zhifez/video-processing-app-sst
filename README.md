# Video Processing App

An event-driven app that utilises FFMPEG to process video.

## System Design

- NextJS App - For user to upload videos and set configs
- UserVideoBucket (S3) - Where the videos will be stored
- VideoRequestQueue (SQS+Lambda) - Subscribe to S3 on object created, send queue
- VideoProcessing (Lambda) - Subscribe to queue, process video using FFMPEG with the given config.json
- DynamoDB (VideoProcessingRequest) - Store request records

## FFMPEG Note

I've yet to figure out how to directly push a layer from sst config, so the FFMPEG layer is manually setup by storing the FFMPEG binary into a S3, assigning it to a layer, before having its arn assigned to a lambda.

The FFMPEG binary is acquired from this site: https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/

## Getting Started

Before you get started:

1. [Configure your AWS credentials](https://docs.sst.dev/advanced/iam-credentials#loading-from-a-file)
2. [Install the SST CLI](https://ion.sst.dev/docs/reference/cli)

To test locally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

To deploy, run:

```bash
sst deploy
```

## Troubleshoot

FFMPEG operation can be quite heavy and timeout a lot:

```
Task timed out after 300.10 seconds
```

When that happens, increase the timeout (max 15 minutes).

```
queueVideoRequest.subscribe({
  handler: 'src/lambdas/video-processing.handler',
  ...
  // FFMPEG might take some time to work depending on video size and complexity of command
  timeout: '5 minutes', // '15 minutes' (max)
  ...
});
```
